### 🧠 Disaster Tweets Classification
This project was developed as part of the Kaggle NLP Getting Started competition, which challenges participants to build a model that predicts whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.

### 📌 Problem Statement
Given a dataset of tweets, build a binary classification model that determines whether each tweet is:

1 = about a real disaster

0 = not about a real disaster

This is a classic NLP text classification task.

### 📁 Dataset
The dataset provided on Kaggle includes:

id: unique identifier
text: the text of the tweet
location: where the tweet was sent from
keyword: a particular keyword from the tweet
target: the label (1 for disaster, 0 for not)

Training is done on the training split and predictions are generated on the test set.

### 📊 Evaluation
Metrics: validation set accuracy

### 🏆 Result
The final model achieved strong performance of 84.43%.

### 🤝 Acknowledgements
Thanks to Kaggle for providing the dataset and challenge.
